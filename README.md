### Hello There!

I'm smolblackcat. I am a computer science student with a great passion for developing software, primarily contributing to open-source projects across the interwebs. I particularly love working with low-level stuff and computer security but I also know how to develop other kinds of software systems as well. I also have a thing for applying good software engineering practises onto my projects and constantly challenging myself to write better and understandable code.

### What I am up to?

I am currently maintaining a simple but useful app called **[Progress][progress-link]**, which is a simple kanban-style task manager for the Linux desktop and Windows systems as well. It is written in C++ with **[LibAdwaita][adwaita-link]** and **[GTK4][gtk-link]** graphical toolkits. And when I am not working on my app, in my free time, I also like to contribute to diverse open-source projects across Github, most of them related to desktop applications for the Linux desktop.

Nowadays, I am investing most of my time studying deeply about operating systems abstractions and design, the computer networking stack (TCP/IP) and the Web application development framework. If you wanna see my [progress][progress-link], check it out my **[little site][cool-site]** (quick disclaimer, it sucks!).
